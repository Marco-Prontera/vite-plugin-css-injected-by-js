# vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js
A Vite plugin that takes the CSS and adds it to the page through the JS. For those who want a single JS file.

## How does it work
Essentially what it does is take all the CSS generated by the build process and add it through javascript. The CSS file is therefore not generated and the declaration in the generated HTML file is also removed.

## Usage
```ts
import cssInjectedByJsPlugin from 'vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js'

export default {
  plugins: [
    cssInJsPlugin(),
  ]
}
```

## Contributions
This is one of the first Vite plugins I do, feel free to open issues and PR. The important thing is that the PRs are created by the develop branch and that everything is explained through the comment and correlated issue.
