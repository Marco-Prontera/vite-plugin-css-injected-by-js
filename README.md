# Vite Plugin: CssInjectedByJs
A Vite plugin that takes the CSS and adds it to the page through the JS. For those who want a single JS file.

## How does it work
Essentially what it does is take all the CSS generated by the build process and add it through javascript. 
The CSS file is therefore not generated and the declaration in the generated HTML file is also removed.

## Installation
```
npm i vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js --save
```

## Usage
```ts
import cssInjectedByJsPlugin from 'vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js'

export default {
  plugins: [
    cssInJsPlugin(),
  ]
}
```

## Contributing
When you make changes to plugin locally, you may want to build the js from the typescript file of the plugin. 
Here the guidelines:
### Install
```
npm install
```
### Build plugin
```
npm run build
```

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more information.
